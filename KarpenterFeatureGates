Black Friday Scaling Issues

And these were the challenges starring at me:

1. Traffic could skyrocket at any moment, requiring immediate node scaling without delays.

2. We heavily relied on Spot Instances. These instances could be reclaimed at any time, creating potential downtime.

3. Over time, some nodes in the cluster could drift from their intended configurations, resulting in wasted resources.

4. High workloads could stress some nodes to failure, requiring quick detection and repairs.

To tackle these challenges, I enabled three powerful Karpenter Feature Gates:

SpotToSpotConsolidation:
Migrates workloads from at-risk spot instances to more stable, cost-effective options before termination.

Drift:
Automatically detects misaligned or underutilized nodes and replaces them to maintain efficiency.

NodeRepair:
Automatically detects unhealthy nodes and repairs or replaces them without manual intervention.
